# Advent of Code Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.
I am starting this challenge on 2023 and I pretend on each year to tackle the daily coding challenges and share my implementations here.

## About

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where participants solve daily coding challenges leading up to Christmas. This repository serves as a collection of my solutions to these challenges. Each day's solution is organized within its own folder, named according to the challenge day.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized by year, with each year containing a folder for each day's challenge. The structure looks like this:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ year
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day-01
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ day-02
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ solution.js
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

Each day's folder contains a README.md file describing the challenge, and a solution file (e.g., `solution.js`).
Additional resources, notes, or input data may also be included in each day's folder.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions and use them for reference or inspiration.
You can navigate to each day's folder to find the challenge description and the corresponding solution file.

To run a specific solution, you can use the provided instructions in each day's README.md file.
Some solutions might have dependencies or additional setup instructions, so be sure to read the documentation for each day.
